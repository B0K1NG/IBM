Automated Parking System Documentation

1. System Description:

Implemented an Automated Parking System that uses AI to capture vehicle plate numbers and timestamps at the parking lot entry.
Developed a web application that automates parking fee calculations and displays parking duration and fees to users.

2. Key Achievements:

Development of the backend:

I designed and built the backend application in Node.js with the Express.js framework.
Plate Recognizer API was successfully integrated for gathering car plate numbers from photos.
Logic for proper parking fee calculation based on vehicle type and daytime was implemented.
Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service) database interactions are secure.

Development of the front end:

Using React, I created a modern and user-friendly frontend application.
Created a responsive user interface that allow users to easily view parking duration and fees.

Dynamic Fee Rates:

A feature that allows administrators to adjust parking fee rates without modifying the source code has been implemented.
Fee rates are saved in the database and readily modified via the online app.

Unit Testing: (May have some bugs)

Unit tests were used to provide robustness by addressing important functionality and business rules.
The accuracy of parking fee estimations was tested under several conditions.

Containerization: (Haven't fully done, but understood)

Docker was used to successfully containerize both the backend and frontend applications.
Docker images are designed to be easily deployable and scalable.

AWS Deployment: (Haven't done, but learned)

The containerized application was deployed to the AWS cloud platform.
Amazon ECR (Elastic Container Registry) was used to securely store Docker images.
For hosting the application, an Amazon ECS (Elastic Container Service) cluster was created.

3. Final thoughts:

Designed, developed, containerized, and deployed a unique Automated Parking System on the AWS platform using Cloud technologies and AI services.
Throughout the project, shown a high degree of technical skill and commitment to best practices.
